# 🚲 Bike Rental Prediction using R (Random Forest)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the **Simplilearn Data Analytics with R Course-End Project**.

The goal is to predict the daily number of bike rentals based on environmental and seasonal conditions using a Machine Learning model.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize seasonal and yearly rental trends
- Build a Random Forest Regression model
- Predict total bike rental demand (`cnt`)

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains daily bike rental records with features such as:

- Season  
- Year & Month  
- Holiday & Working Day  
- Weather Situation  
- Temperature, Humidity, Windspeed  
- Total Rentals (`cnt`)  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- R Programming  
- ggplot2 (Data Visualization)  
- caret (Train-Test Split & Metrics)  
- randomForest (Machine Learning Model)

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis
The following visualizations were created:

- Monthly rental distribution  
- Yearly rental trends  
- Outlier detection using boxplots  

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
A **Random Forest Regression Model** was trained to predict daily rentals.

### Model Performance:
- **R² Score:** ~0.89  
- **RMSE:** ~675  
- Variance Explained: ~87%

---

## 📌 Key Insights
- Temperature and season are the most important predictors.
- Bike rentals increase significantly during warmer months.
- Weather conditions strongly influence rental demand.
